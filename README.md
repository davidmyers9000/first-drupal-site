Hi! This is just a simple test site built to get a Drupal dev server install automated with a Vagrant/Puppet combo. The advantages of this rig allow anyone who clones this repo to get setup with a Drupal dev server in as few steps as possible so developers can jump straight into developing with Drupal in as few steps as poosible.

My plan is to expand this repo into a sweet Drupal command-line dev rig including Drush, Ruby, Compass, Sass, & CoffeeScript. The hope is to make it easy for Front-end developers to bootstrap quickly with Drupal using the latest most powerful web dev tools.

### Stay Tuned!
